Testing your microdata
----------------------

This product also include a JavaScript tester microdata tool called `Microdata Tool`__.
To enable it while testing your site, just run the *testing* Generic Setup profile from
your *site_setup* tool.

This will enable a JavaScript snippet in every pages. Unluckily the Plone Sunburst CSS styles 
are really crappy sometimes, so the layout will not be perfect if you are using this theme.
