Introduction
============

This product is designed for adding `microdata`__ support to your Plone contents.

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29

How to use
==========

This package simply provides raw support, not really useful on his own. It is intended to be
extended by 3rd party projects that want provide microdata support for Plone.

One complete implementation of all instruction below is `collective.microdata.event`__.

The microdata vocabulary
------------------------

Every content type that wanna provide microdata informations needs to provide an adapter for the
``IMicrodataVocabulary`` interface. This interface is limited to a single information: an **URI
to a microdata vocabulary**.

Microdata vocabulary are standardized outside HTML 5 specifications, so is possible to have
different families of vocabularies. You can also invent your own.

The schema.org implementation
-----------------------------

Nowadays the most promising implementation of microdata is the one defined at `schema.org`__ so this
package is supporting it. This is done providing the most-generic type defined: the `Thing`__ type.

__ http://schema.org/
__ http://schema.org/Thing

This is automatically done for all Plone content types and catalog objects (for catalog: a new
catalog metadata ``microdata_itemtype`` will be added to your catalog, saving there the most
specific microdata vocabulary URL found).

This is done providing adapters for ``ISchemaOrgThing`` interface (that extends ``IMicrodataVocabulary``).

Again: knowing that all your Plone content types are "things" is not very funny, and not a real step
forward.

How to extend
=============

From contents
-------------

To get microdata information from a content types, your product must provide his own implementation for
the ``IMicrodataVocabulary``::

    <adapter for="your.products.content.IType"
             provides="collective.microdata.core.interfaces.IMicrodataVocabulary"
             factory=".adapter.YourTypeMicrodataProvider" />

Then you need to provide the adapter::

    class YourTypeMicrodataProvider(object):
    implements(IYourMicrodataVocabulary)
    
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.microdata_vocabulary = 'http://your.microdata.uri'
        # now get data from the content
        self.microdata_data1 = ... 

Then your content's view must obtain the microdata adapter you defined::

    class YourTypeView(BrowserView):
    
        ...
    
        def microdata(self):
            return IMicrodataVocabulary(self.context)


Finally your view template must use microdata information::

    ...
    <article metal:fill-slot="main"
             tal:define="microdata view/microdata"
             itemscope="itemscope"
             tal:attributes="itemtype microdata/microdata_vocabulary">
    ...


From catalog
------------

The portal catalog ``microdata_itemtype`` column will automatically store the content microdata
vocabulary URL. Default value is the "Thing" URL (http://schema.org/Thing) but as soon as you
provide a more specific adapter, this URL will be replaced with the new ones.

There's an adapter for getting raw ``Thing`` microdata from a catalog brain from all Plone content
types, but your 3rd party content type must also provide a more specific ones::

    <adapter for="Products.ZCatalog.interfaces.ICatalogBrain"
             provides="collective.microdata.core.interfaces.IMicrodataVocabulary"
             factory=".adapter.YourTypeMicrodataBrainProvider"
             name="http://your.microdata.uri" />

Then you need to provide the adapter::

    class YourTypeMicrodataBrainProvider(object):
    implements(IYourMicrodataVocabulary)
    
    def __init__(self, brain):
        self.microdata_vocabulary = 'http://your.microdata.uri'
        # now get data from the cataloged content
        self.microdata_data1 = ... 

Support for folder content listing views
========================================

If you want to provide microdata information also in folder content views (so displaying multiple
microdata objects in a single page), you could like to install `collective.microdata.contentlisting`__.

__ https://github.com/keul/collective.microdata.contentlisting

See it's documentation for further information on how to use this in you product.

Testing your microdata
======================

This product also include a JavaScript tester microdata tool called `Microdata Tool`__
(a modified ones, just to fix some crappy Sunburst CSS rules).

__ http://krofdrakula.github.com/microdata-tool/

To enable it while testing your site, just run the *testing* Generic Setup profile from
your *site_setup* tool. 

This will enable the JavaScript tester in every page.

**Hint**: duration checker seems not working properly.

Final notes
===========

Providing microdata doesn't ensure that search engines will use it.
